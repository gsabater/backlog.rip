After many years and a lot of work, steam-backlog.com has evolved into backlog.rip.

What started as a tool for managing your Steam games has now transformed into a comprehensive platform for organizing your entire games library. Fueled by innovative ideas and a passion for gaming, I invite you to join me on this exciting journey.

With the transition to backlog.rip, we're maintaining the features you've come to rely on from steam-backlog.com. My commitment to providing a reliable tool for managing your Steam games remains unchanged and the core functionality is the same.

As we move forward, I'm excited about the potential for growth and the opportunity to bring you even more features in the future. Thank you for being part of this journey.
